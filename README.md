This fork of Neofetch is less bloated but does not support:<br>
MacOS<br>
IOS<br>
FreeBSD<br>
Gnome<br>
Itunes<br>
ChromeOS<br>
<br>
Because i think said software shouldn't be used, the lines of code refering to them is a waste of space.<br>
The removal of these LOC (546 of them) made this fork 20 KB lighter.<br>
(I also deleted some copyright comments)
